# **Module 01: Introduction to Ethical Hacking**

## **Information Security Overview**
Information security refers to the protection or safeguarding of information and information systems that use, store and trasmit information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

### ðŸ”· **Elements of Information Security**

* **Confidentiality**
    * Confidentiality is the assurance that the information is accessible only to authorized.
        * Confidentiality breaches may occur due to improper data handling or a hacking attempt.

* **Integrity**
    * Integrity is the trustworthiness of data or resources in the prevention of improper and unauthorized changes - the assurance that information is sufficiently accurate for its purpose.
        * Measures to maintain data integrity may include a checksum (a number produced by a mathematical function to verify that a given block of data is not changed) and access control.

* **Availability**
    * Availability is the assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by authorized users.
        * Measures to maintain data availability can include disk arrays for redundant systems and clustered machines, antivirus software to combat malware, ...

* **Authenticity**
    * Authenticity refers to the characteristic of communication, documents, or any data that ensures the quality of being genuine or uncorrupted.
        * The major role of authentication is to confirm that the user is genuine.

* **Non-Repudiation**
    * Non-Repudiation is a way to guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message.

### ðŸ”· **Motives, Goals & Objectives of Information Security Attacks**

**```Attacks = Motive (Goal) + Method + Vulnerability```**

#### **Motives behind information security attacks**

## **Cyber Kill Chain Concepts**
The cyber kill chain is an efficient and effective way of illustrating how an adversary can attack the target organization. This model helps organizations understand the various possible threats at every stage of an attack and the necessary countermeasures to defend against such attacks.

<br>

### ðŸ”· **Cyber Kill Chain Methodology**

![CyberKillChain](https://nucleon-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cyber_Kill_Chain.jpg)

* **Reconnaissance**
    * Collecting as much information as possible about the target to probe for weak points before actually attacking. Such as publicly available information, network information, etc. This kind of information can help gaining backdoor access to the target network.

* **Weaponization**
    * Analyse the gathered data to identify the vulnerabilities and techniques that can exploit and gain unauthorized access to the target organization

* **Delivery**
    * The payload created in the previous step is being transmitted to the indented victim(s) as an email attachment, via a malicious link on websites, etc.

* **Exploitation**
    * After the "weapon" is transmitted to the inteded victim, exploitation triggers the adversary's malicious code to exploit a vulnerability in the operating system, application or server on a target system

* **Installation**
    * Downloads and installs more malicious software on the target system to maintain access to the target network for an extended period. They may use the weapon to install a backdoor to gain remote access.

* **Command and Control**
    * Creates a command and control channel, which established two-way communication between the victim's system and adversary-controlled server to communicate and pass data back and forth.

* **Exfiltration**
    * Victim's system is controllable from a remote location and finally accomplishes their inteded goals. The adversary gains access to confidential data, disrupts the services or network, etc.

<br>

### ðŸ”· **Tactics, Techniques & Procedures (TTPs)**

The terms "tactics, techniques & procedures" refer to the patterns of activities and methods associated with the specific threat actors or groups of theat actors.

* **Tactics**
    * Tactics describe the way the threat actor operates during different phases of an attack

* **Techniques**
    * To launch an attack successfully, theat actors use several techniques during its execution. These techniques include initial exploitation, setting up and maintaining command and control channels, etc.

* **Procedures**
    * Procedures involve a sequence of actions performed by the threat actors to execute different steps of an attack life cycle.

<br>

### ðŸ”· **Adversary Behavioral Identification**
Adversary behavioral identification involves the identification of the common methods or techniques followed by an adversary to launch attacks to penetrate on organization's network.

* **Internal Reconnaissance**
    * Once adversary is inside the target network, they follow various techniques and methods to carry out internal reconnaissance. (Enumeration of systems, hosts, processes, etc.)

* **Use of PowerShell**
    * PowerShell can be used by an adversary as a tool for automating data exfiltration and launching further attacks

* **Unspecified Proxy Activities**
    * Create and configure multiple domains pointing to the same host, thus, allowing an adversary to switch quickly between the domains to avoid detection

* **Use of Command-Line Interface**
    * On gaining access to a system an adversary can use the CLI to interact with the target system.

* **HTTP User Agent**
    * In HTTP-based communication, the server identifies the connected HTTP client using the user agent field. An adversary modifies the content of this field to communicate with the compromised system.

* **Command & Control Server**
    * Command & Control server are being used to communicate remotely with compromised systems through encrypted sessions.

* **Use of DNS Tunneling**
    * DNS tunneling can be used to obfuscate malicious traffic in the legitement traffic carried by common protocols used in the network.

* **Use of Web Shell**
    * An adversary uses a web shell to manipulate the web server by creating a shell within a website, it allows an adversary to gain remote access to the functionalities of a server.

* **Data Staging**
    * After successful penetration into a target's network, the adversary uses data staging techniques to collect and combine as much data as possible.

### ðŸ”· **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**
Cyber threats are continuously evolving with the newer TTPs adapted based on the vulnerabilities of the target organization. Security professionals must perform continious monitoring of IoCs to effectively and efficienttly detect and respond to evolving cyber threats.

* **Email Indicators**
    * Attackers usually prefer email services to send malicious data to the target organization or individual. Such socially engineered emails are preferred due to their ease of use and comparative anonymity.

* **Network Indicators**
    * Network indicators are useful for command and control, malware delivery, and identifying details about the operating system, browser typen and other computer-specific information.

* **Host-Based Indicators**
    * Host-Based indicators are found by performing an analysis of the infected system within the organizational network.

* **Behavioral Indicators**
    * Generally, typical IoCs are useful for identifying indicators of intrusion, such as malicious IP addresses, virus signatures, etc.

<br>

## **Hacking Concepts**

### ðŸ”· **What is Hacking?**

Hacking in the field of computer security refers to exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized or inappropriate access to system resources. It involves a modifying system or application features to achieve a goal outside its creator's original purpose.

<br>

### ðŸ”· **Who is a Hacker?**
A hacker is a person who breaks into a system or network without authorization to destroy, steal sensitive data or perform malicious attacks.

    * Employed by the government to penetrate, gain top-level information from, and damage the information systems of other governments.

* **Hacktivists**
    * Hacktivism is when hackers break into government or corporate computer systems as an act of protest.

<br>

### ðŸ”· **Hacking Phases**

* **Reconnaissance**
    * As mentioned before, in this phase the hacker gathers as much information as possible of the target before launching an attack

* **Scanning**
    * In this phase the hacker uses the information gathered in the previous phase to scan the network for specific information for example open ports, network IP addresses, services, etc.

* **Gaining Access**
    * This phases is the phases where the real hacking occurs, the hacker uses the gathered information out of the scanning phase to search for vulnerabilities to exploit.

* **Maintaining Access**
    * After a hacker got access to the system with admin or root-level privileges, he/she can use both the system and the system resources at will. Therefor the hacker installs a backdoor or Trojan Horse to keep a way to access the system on a later moment.

* **Clearing Tracks**
    * A hacker will usually attempt to erase all evidence of their action to remain undetected but still maintaining access to the compromised system or network.

### ðŸ”· **What is Risk?**

* The probability of the occurance of a threat or an event that will damage, cause loss to, or have other negative impacts on the organization.

* The possibility of a threat acting upon an internal or external vulnerability and causing harm to a resource

* The product of the likelihood that an event will occur and the impact that the event might have on an information technology asset.

Relation between Risk, Threats, Vulnerabilities and Impact:<br>
**```RISK = Threats x Vulnerabilities x Impact```**

<br>

The impact of an event on an information asset is the product of vulnerability in the asset and the asset's value to its stakeholders:<br>
**```RISK = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset Value```**

<br> 

### ðŸ”· **Risk Level**
Risk level is an assessment of the resulted impact on the network.<br>
**```Level of Risk = Consequence x Likelihood```** 

### ðŸ”· **Risk Matrix**
The risk matrix scales the risk occurance or likelihood probability, along with its consequences or impact.<br>
